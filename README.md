# Exploring Metabolic Anomalies in COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19: A Machine Learning Approach with Explainable Artificial Intelligence

Overview

This repository hosts the Jupyter Notebooks and datasets used in our study "Exploring Metabolic Anomalies in COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19: A Machine Learning Approach with Explainable Artificial Intelligence". Our research employed machine learning (ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze metabolic alterations in COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 patients.
